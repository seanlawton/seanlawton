I’m a Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at George Mason University and founder of the Mason Experimental Geometry Lab. I work with teams of undergraduate and graduate students in experimental research and visualization projects, and also am involved in hands-on outreach activities about mathematics to K-12 schools.
